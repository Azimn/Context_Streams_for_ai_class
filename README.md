Fantasy film
I used midjourney primarily to create fantasy images and then an AI face-swapping tool to superimpose the faces of my children onto the characters. This process was particularly fulfilling, as it blended personal creativity with the technical capabilities of AI to produce something both unique and meaningful.
Building on these visuals, I used AI video-generation tools to animate the images into short video clips. This step underscored the impressive potential of AI in multimedia production, as I was able to create visually compelling content in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional animation techniques. However, the process also exposed significant limitations, such as difficulties in maintaining consistent character designs and logical animations across clips, as well as the restricted length of the generated videos (typically 5–10 seconds).
To address these limitations, I used Adobe Premiere to manually edit and assemble the AI-generated clips into a cohesive video. I added AI-generated audio and sound effects using tools like Eleven Labs and Udio, further enhancing the final product. Despite the challenges, I was ultimately pleased with the outcome, as it demonstrated both the current power and the future potential of AI-driven tools in filmmaking.








Book Project
# List of Books for the base of my series
- "David Copperfield" by Charles Dickens** – David’s early years establish the foundation of resilience and ambition as he faces a world that tests his innocence and moral compass. A natural "first chapter" for a journey that evolves in complexity.

- "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë** – Continuing with a character like David, now as Jane, the story deepens the protagonist’s exploration of love, independence, and moral conviction, tested in a much darker, more intimate setting.

- "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Baroness Orczy** – In this "next installment," the protagonist would embody an outwardly frivolous yet secretly courageous hero facing high-stakes intrigue and sacrifice, with a blend of moral ambiguity.

- "Les Misérables" by Victor Hugo – Jean Valjean: Valjean’s redemption arc and his continuous fight for moral integrity against societal injustice expand the protagonist’s journey into one of sacrifice, compassion, and struggle against fate.

- "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott – Jo March: Bringing a family dynamic and personal growth into focus, Jo March’s story explores artistic ambitions, love, and identity, building on the protagonist’s journey toward self-realization and independence.

- "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas – Edmond Dantès: In a phase focused on revenge and redemption, the protagonist’s journey takes a darker turn, filled with adventure and the consequences of past choices, fitting for a later “installment.”

- "Anne of Green Gables" by L.M. Montgomery – Anne Shirley: As the "final book," Anne’s optimism and creativity bring a lighter yet still profound conclusion to the journey, where the protagonist finds acceptance, purpose, and joy in a settled life.
