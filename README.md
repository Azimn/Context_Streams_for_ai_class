# List of Books for the base of my series
- "David Copperfield" by Charles Dickens** – David’s early years establish the foundation of resilience and ambition as he faces a world that tests his innocence and moral compass. A natural "first chapter" for a journey that evolves in complexity.

- "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë** – Continuing with a character like David, now as Jane, the story deepens the protagonist’s exploration of love, independence, and moral conviction, tested in a much darker, more intimate setting.

- "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Baroness Orczy** – In this "next installment," the protagonist would embody an outwardly frivolous yet secretly courageous hero facing high-stakes intrigue and sacrifice, with a blend of moral ambiguity.

- "Les Misérables" by Victor Hugo – Jean Valjean: Valjean’s redemption arc and his continuous fight for moral integrity against societal injustice expand the protagonist’s journey into one of sacrifice, compassion, and struggle against fate.

- "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott – Jo March: Bringing a family dynamic and personal growth into focus, Jo March’s story explores artistic ambitions, love, and identity, building on the protagonist’s journey toward self-realization and independence.

- "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas – Edmond Dantès: In a phase focused on revenge and redemption, the protagonist’s journey takes a darker turn, filled with adventure and the consequences of past choices, fitting for a later “installment.”

- "Anne of Green Gables" by L.M. Montgomery – Anne Shirley: As the "final book," Anne’s optimism and creativity bring a lighter yet still profound conclusion to the journey, where the protagonist finds acceptance, purpose, and joy in a settled life.
