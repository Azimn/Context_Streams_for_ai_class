Step 1: Game Conceptualization
A. Define the Game's Theme and Setting

Let's brainstorm some themes:

Space Adventure: Navigate through alien planets collecting lost spaceship parts.
Jungle Quest: A treasure hunter exploring ancient ruins in a dense jungle.
Cyberpunk City: A hacker traversing rooftops to stop a rogue AI.
Underwater World: A deep-sea diver collecting pearls while avoiding sea creatures.
B. Main Character Design

Depending on the theme, we'll create a protagonist that fits the setting.
Use DALL·E 3 to generate character sprites.
C. Objective and Goals

Primary Goal: Reach the end of each level while overcoming obstacles.
Secondary Goals: Collect items, defeat enemies, achieve high scores.
