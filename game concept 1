Step 1: Game Conceptualization
A. Define the Game's Theme and Setting

Let's brainstorm some themes:

Space Adventure: Navigate through alien planets collecting lost spaceship parts.
Jungle Quest: A treasure hunter exploring ancient ruins in a dense jungle.
Cyberpunk City: A hacker traversing rooftops to stop a rogue AI.
Underwater World: A deep-sea diver collecting pearls while avoiding sea creatures.
B. Main Character Design

Depending on the theme, we'll create a protagonist that fits the setting.
Use DALL·E 3 to generate character sprites.
C. Objective and Goals

Primary Goal: Reach the end of each level while overcoming obstacles.
Secondary Goals: Collect items, defeat enemies, achieve high scores.

Creating a Platformer in GB Studio with Character Selection and Unique Abilities

Creating a platformer game in GB Studio that features character selection similar to Super Mario 2, with three unique characters, is an exciting project. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you construct your game in GB Studio, focusing on implementing the specific features you've described.

Prerequisites
GB Studio installed on your computer.
Graphics Assets: Sprites for the characters, enemies, backgrounds, and tilesets.
Audio Assets: Sound effects and music.
Basic Understanding of GB Studio's Interface.
Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Open GB Studio and select "New Project".
Choose the "Platformer" template to start with basic platformer mechanics.
Name your project and select the directory where you want to save it.
Step 2: Create the Character Selection Menu
To implement a character selection menu similar to Super Mario 2:

Design the Menu Scene:

Go to the Scenes panel and create a new scene named "Character Select".
Set the scene type to "UI" to make it a non-scrolling menu.
Design the Menu Background:

Use a graphics editor to create a background image that includes the three characters.
Import the background into GB Studio via the "Backgrounds" asset panel.
Implement Menu Navigation:

Place Actor Buttons over each character on the menu using the "Add Actor" tool.
Assign a unique "On Interact" script to each actor that sets the chosen character.
Set Variables for Character Selection:

Create a global variable (e.g., player_character) to store the selected character.
Script the Selection Process:

For each character's "On Interact" script:
Use the "Set Variable" event to assign a unique value to player_character (e.g., 1 for the small boy, 2 for the older boy, 3 for the girl).
Add a "Switch Scene" event to transition to the first level.
Step 3: Import and Set Up Character Sprites
Prepare Character Sprites:

Each character sprite should be formatted according to GB Studio's requirements (preferably 16x16 or 16x32 pixels).
Create separate sprites for each character's animations (idle, walk, jump, actions).
Import Sprites:

In the "Sprites" asset panel, import each character's spritesheets.
Define animations for each action by setting up frames and animation loops.
Create Player Actors for Each Character:

In the "Actors" panel, create a new actor for each character.
Assign the corresponding sprite and set the actor type to "Player".
Step 4: Implement Character Abilities
To give each character unique abilities, you'll use GB Studio's event scripting.

Small Boy (Super Strong and Can Dance)
Strength Ability:

Use a variable (e.g., isStrong) that's true when the small boy is selected.
In enemy collision events, check if isStrong is true to allow the boy to defeat certain enemies or push heavy objects.
Dance Ability:

Create an input event (e.g., pressing a specific button) that triggers the dance animation.
Use the "Start Animation" event to play the dance.
Older Boy (Uses a Large Book)
Book Abilities:

Assign an input (e.g., pressing the action button) to open the book.
Use "If Variable" checks to determine if the older boy is selected.
Implement abilities like growing a vine:
Use the "Spawn Actor" event to create a vine actor at the player's position.
Define the vine actor to grow upward over time.
Access Restrictions:

Prevent the older boy from entering small areas by adding collision blocks or using variables to check character type.
Small Girl (Rides a Large Black Cat)
Summon Cat Ability:

Assign an input to summon the cat.
Use the "Spawn Actor" event to create the cat actor.
Set the cat as the controllable player character when summoned.
Cat Mechanics:

Define the cat's abilities (swipe, jump, run) by setting up its animations and input events.
When the girl dismounts:
Switch control back to the girl.
Adjust her abilities accordingly (e.g., she can't attack but can enter small areas).
Invincibility and Access:

For the girl, set a variable (e.g., isInvincible) to prevent damage when not on the cat.
Use "If Variable" checks during enemy collisions to implement this.
Step 5: Configure Level Design
Design Levels Similar to Super Mario 2:

Use the "Scenes" panel to create levels with platforms, obstacles, and enemies.
Import tilesets that match your game's aesthetic.
Implement Character-Specific Paths:

Include areas accessible only by certain characters.
Use collision blocks and variables to restrict or allow access.
Place Interactive Elements:

Add objects that interact with character abilities (e.g., heavy blocks for the small boy to move).
Step 6: Set Up Enemy Characters
Design Enemy Sprites:

Create and import sprites for your unique villains.
Configure Enemy Behaviors:

Use the "Actors" panel to define enemy movements and interactions.
Set up scripts for enemy behaviors (patrol, chase, attack).
Step 7: Implement Game Mechanics
Health and Lives:

Create variables to track player health and lives.
Use UI elements to display this information on-screen.
Checkpoints and Save Systems:

Place checkpoints in levels using actors.
Script events to save the player's progress.
Power-Ups and Collectibles:

Design items that enhance abilities or provide bonuses.
Use collision events to handle item pickups.
Step 8: Add Audio
Import Music and Sound Effects:

In the "Music" and "Sounds" panels, import your audio assets.
Ensure they are in compatible formats (e.g., .wav, .mod).
Assign Audio to Events:

Set background music for levels.
Attach sound effects to actions (jumping, attacking, etc.).
Step 9: Testing and Debugging
Test Each Character Individually:

Play through levels with each character to ensure their abilities work as intended.
Check Scene Transitions:

Ensure that moving between levels and the character selection menu works smoothly.
Debug Issues:

Use GB Studio's debugging tools to identify and fix any errors or glitches.
Step 10: Export and Share Your Game
Export the Game:

Use the "Build" option to compile your game for the Game Boy, or export it as a ROM file.
Play on Emulator or Hardware:

Test the game on a Game Boy emulator or real hardware if available.
Additional Tips
Use Variables Effectively:

Variables are crucial for tracking states like which character is selected and their abilities.
Modular Scripting:

Keep your scripts organized by grouping events related to specific functionalities.
Asset Management:

Name your assets clearly to keep track of them easily.
Community Resources:

Refer to GB Studio forums and communities for additional help and asset sharing.
Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll be able to create a platformer game in GB Studio featuring a character selection menu and three unique characters with distinct abilities. Remember to iteratively test your game to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. Good luck with your game development journey!
